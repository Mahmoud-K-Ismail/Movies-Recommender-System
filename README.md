# Movies-Recommender-System
Welcome to the Movies Recommender System repository! This project implements various recommendation algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and ratings. The system uses collaborative filtering (both user-user and item-item) and content-based filtering techniques to predict user preferences and recommend movies.
